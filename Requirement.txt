Perfect! ðŸš€ Since youâ€™re self-learning C++, Iâ€™ll break this **Bank Project** into **tasks** (like checkpoints). Each task will help you **build step by step**, instead of jumping into the full project at once.

## ðŸ“Œ Task-Based Roadmap for C++ Bank Project

### **Task 1: Basic C++ Refresh**

âœ… Write a simple program that:

* Takes your name and balance as input.
* Prints a welcome message with your balance.
  *(Goal: practice `cin`, `cout` and variables)*

---

### **Task 2: Create an Account Class**

âœ… Define a class `Account` with:

* Data members â†’ `accountNumber`, `name`, `balance`
* Member functions â†’ `createAccount()`, `displayAccount()`
  *(Goal: understand OOP basics and encapsulation)*

---

### **Task 3: Deposit & Withdraw**

âœ… Add two methods:

* `deposit(amount)` â†’ increases balance
* `withdraw(amount)` â†’ decreases balance (check if sufficient)
  *(Goal: practice member functions & conditions)*

---

### **Task 4: Manage Multiple Accounts**

âœ… Use a `vector<Account>` (or array) to store multiple accounts.

* Write a function to **search account by accountNumber**.
* Add menu options to **create, deposit, withdraw, show account**.
  *(Goal: practice STL containers and loops)*

---

### **Task 5: File Handling**

âœ… Store accounts permanently:

* Save all accounts into a file (`accounts.dat`).
* Load accounts from file when program starts.
  *(Goal: practice `fstream` for save/load data)*

---

### **Task 6: Menu-Driven Program**

âœ… Create a loop with options:

1. Create account
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Balance enquiry
5. List all accounts
6. Exit
   *(Goal: combine everything into a working mini-project)*

---

### **Task 7 (Optional - Advanced):**

âœ… Add more real-bank features:

* Account **deletion**
* **Password/PIN** protection
* Interest calculation
* Switch from **file** â†’ **database (SQLite/MySQL)**

---

ðŸ‘‰ My suggestion:

* Complete **Task 1 â†’ Task 3** in one go (theyâ€™re small).
* Then move to **Task 4 & 5** (they are the real project base).
* End with **Task 6** (final working bank project).

Do you want me to **write the code skeleton** for **Task 1 to Task 3** (basic version without file handling) so you can start coding right away?
